# About Me
I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology. I completed my postdoctoral research in Beijing Institute of Technology in September 2025, under the supervision of Professor Wang Guoren. I had previously received my Ph.D. from the same institution in 2023, working under the guidance of Professor [Ronghua Li](https://ronghuali.github.io). 

My research interests include graph data management and mining, social network analysis, graph computation systems, etc.

**I welcome applications from motivated students and typically have openings for one PhD student and 2-3 Master's students annually. If you are interested in joining our research group, please feel free to reach out to me.**
