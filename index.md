# About Me

I'm currently a DevOps Engineer at [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com) in
Paris, France since March 2023.

Before that, I worked at Cisco from 2019 to 2023 as a Network Engineer on
scalable end-to-end encryption solutions for real-time communications.

I graduated from [Imperial
College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/secure-software-systems/)
of a MSc in Computing Security and Reliability in 2019 and from [Telecom
Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) of a *Diplôme d’ingénieur* (MSc in
Engineering) in 2020.
